Get-Service                                       # Run get-service command and inputs that and the results into the transcript.
Stop-Transcript                                   # End the transcript
notepad c:\MyWork.txt                             # View the contents of the created transcript

# Linux Essentials (Day 2)

## PWD 
```
student:~$ pwd 
/home/student 
```

## Situational Awareness
```
hostname or uname -a displays the name of the host you are currently on.

whoami shows the user you are currently logged in as (useful after gaining access through service exploitation).

w or who shows who else is logged in.

ip addr or ifconfig displays network interfaces and configured IP addresses.

ip neigh or arp displays MAC addresses of devices observed on the network.

ip route or route shows where packets will be routed for a particular destination address.

ss or netstat will show network connections, with the appropriate flags will show listening ports

nft list tables or iptables -L to view firewall rules. (FIREWALL RULES)

sudo -l displays commands the user may run with elevated permissions.

```


## Help

```
help

--help

man

```


## Variables

Assigning 
```

a = 100
echo $a

```

$ is used to call your variable

## Command Substitution

```
student:~$ directories=$(ls /) 
student:~$ echo $directories 
bin   dev  home        initrd.img.old  lib64       media  opt   root  sbin  srv  tmp  var      vmlinuz.old
boot  etc  initrd.img  lib             lost+found  mnt    proc  run   snap  sys  usr  vmlinuz

```


## Redirection

standard input 0 ←--- the default for a command arguments

standard output 1 ←--- the default for successful command output

standard error 2 ←--- the default for failed commands or errors


```

student:~$ ls bacon 
ls: cannot access 'bacon': No such file or directory

workstation21:$ ls bacon 2> errorfile 
workstation21:$ cat errorfile 
ls: cannot access 'bacon': No such file or directory

```


## For Loop

## If


```
student:~$ for object in $objects; \ 
do if [ -d $object ]; then echo "$object is a directory"; \ 
else echo "$object is file" ; \

done 

/etc/X11 is a directory

/etc/adduser.conf is a file
/etc/alternatives is a directory
/etc/anacrontab is a file
/etc/apg.conf is a file

```

## While

```

echo $curtime

exittime=$(expr $curtime + 3) 
echo $exittime

while [ $exittime -ge $curtime ]; do echo "To Infinity and Beyond?" ; curtime=$(date +"%s") ; done 
To Infinity and Beyond?

## File

Can allow you to see what type of file your file are.
elf binary


## /etc/passwd

```

student@linux-opstation-kspt:/bin$ cat /etc/passwd | grep student 
student:x:1001:1001::/home/student:/bin/bash 
 (1)   (2) (3) (4) (5)   (6)          (7)


cmd line: Execute cat /etc/passwd and pipe it to grep to filter on student.
cmd output: Student entry in the /etc/passwd file.



Sections of output lines
Username
Password. An x character indicates that an encrypted password is stored in /etc/shadow file.
UID Value
GUID Value

## Permissions

Read
Read contents (File)
List contents of dir (Dir)

Write

Create/Delete in the dir (Dir)

Exe 
Run file as an executable (File)

Showing permissions.
2 The Owner has Read, Write, and Execute permissions.
3 The Group has Read and Execute permissions.
4 Anyone who is not the User/Owner or belonging to the Group has Read and Execute permissions.
5 The file’s Owner.
6 The files' Group.
```

## Sticky Bit

Only the owner of the sticky bit can delete the file
If a user has write access to a directory, they can delete any file from it. That may cause problems though in some directories like /var/tmp. To address this Linux has what is known as the sticky bit. The sticky bit removes the ability to delete files unless the user attempting is the owner of the file.



## Special Permisions

```
SUID or GUID Bit

SUID and SGID Demo
student@linux-opstation-kspt:~$ ls -l /bin/ping 
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 64424 Jun 28  2019 /bin/ping 

Execute ls -l on /bin/ping.
Notice the s in the users field? What permissions does this executable effectively have?
